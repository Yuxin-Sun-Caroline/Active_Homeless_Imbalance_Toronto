#Active Homeless Population: A Growing Imbalance in Proportions#

# Description

This paper analyzes the population distribution of individuals experiencing homelessness in Toronto over time. In particular, it explores the trends and changes in the homeless population from 2018 to 2024, focusing on key demographic groups such as refugees, single adults, and male homelessness. By examining these trends, the paper aims to provide insights into the challenges faced by Toronto's shelter system and the impact of homelessness on the city.

Some of the R code used to create this work was adapted from Alexander (2023).
